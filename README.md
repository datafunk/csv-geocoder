# CSV-Geocoder

This project succeeds [js.geocoder](https://bitbucket.org/datafunk/js.geocoder/) (0.4.0), which is a web / GUI for geocoding addresses using Google Maps API.

__csv-geocoder 0.5.0__ is built based on the aforementioned __js.geocoder__. Once completed though, it did not make sense to house it in the same repo as a separate branch. I could rather see to update its predecessor to use this utility in the background to satisfy the needs of my original target audience.

__0.5.0__ is fully functional, but lacks tests, documentation, help utilities etc. The plan is to complete these, then publish to npm.

ON the note of versioning, I first saw the nodejs port as a direct part of the original project and aiming to follow semantic versioning I bumped it to _1.0.0-beta_, but I do not feel that this tool is really quite that mature yet. Since I moved it to a separate repo and renamed it too, I thought it's appropriate enough to drop back versioning. To indicate its heritage, I decided to start with 0.5.0.
