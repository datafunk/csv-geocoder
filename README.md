# CSV-Geocoder

This project succeeds [js.geocoder](https://bitbucket.org/datafunk/js.geocoder/) (0.4.0), which is a web / GUI for geocoding addresses using Google Maps API. It is a _work in progress_!

__csv-geocoder 0.5.0__ is built based on the aforementioned __js.geocoder__. When completed the initial porting, it did no longer made sense to house it in the same repo, so it got a new - more descriptive - name and repo. I could rather see to update its predecessor to use this on the backend.

__0.5.0__ is functional, but lacks tests, documentation, help utilities and guaranteed to be buggy. The plan is to complete these, iron out the bugs and eventually publish to npm.
