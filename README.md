# CSV-Geocoder

This project succeeds [js.geocoder](https://bitbucket.org/datafunk/js.geocoder/) (0.4.0), which is a web / GUI for geocoding addresses using Google Maps API.

1.0.0-beta is fully functional, but lacks tests, documentation, help utilities etc.
The plan is to complete these, then publish to npm.
